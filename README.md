> My personal journey learning Vue 3 — one commit at a time.

## 🚀 About

This repository documents my progress as I learn Vue.js from the ground up.  
Expect messy experiments, lots of trial and error, and steady improvement along the way.

I'm not aiming for perfection — I'm aiming for **understanding**.  
If you're also learning Vue, feel free to clone, explore, and laugh at my early commits.

## 🧠 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Vue 3
- Practice with real components and small projects
- Track progress with clear, meaningful commits
- Learn by doing (and occasionally breaking things)

## 🛠️ Tools & Stack

- [Vue.js 3](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) — depending on the project
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Acode](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foxdebug.acode) on mobile
- Git + GitHub

## 📚 Sources & Inspiration

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/)
- [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/)
- YouTube tutorials, docs, StackOverflow, and pure chaos

## 📅 Progress Log

I'll try to keep commits atomic and descriptive, so the repo can be browsed commit-by-commit like a learning diary.

## 🤝 Contributions

This repo is personal, but if you’re another learner and want to share feedback or ideas — feel free to open an issue or say hi.

Made with ☕, curiosity, and occasional frustration.
